Squalit is Thunderbird extension that is intended as a companion 
program to callPopPy (http://www.oak-wood.co.uk/callpoppy/).

callPopPy is an incoming call popup notifier for the Asterisk server
(http://www.asterisk.org/). Squalit exports the contents of 
Thunderird's address book to a SQLite database, in a format that allows
callPopPy to look up the name of an incoming caller and display that.

Squalit can be configured to periodically update callPopPy's database.
